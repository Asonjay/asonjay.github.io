Welcome to the third version of my digital space! As a first-year PhD student still exploring research directions, I've found myself with pockets of time to do something "useless" yet satisfying—fine-tuning my personal website. There's something uniquely rewarding about web development: the instant visual feedback, the satisfaction of discovering new building blocks, and the joy of assembling them with your own aesthetic touch. And speaking of aesthetics, mine have evolved quite a bit, as evidenced by this being my third iteration!

## The Bootstrap Beginning

My website journey began during my master's program, sparked by a simple observation: everyone around me had a GitHub Pages site. Why not join in? Armed with some frontend knowledge from my internship at [AI Camp](https://www.ai-camp.org/), I dove into the world of HTML/CSS and Bootstrap.

My first site was built using the "Brandon Johnson" Resume template from [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-my-resume/). As a perfectionist, I distinctly remember spending hours tweaking margins and padding—a tedious yet oddly satisfying process. This project even led me to help build my wife's website ([check it out here](https://jingwen-he.github.io/)).

## The Academic Template Phase

After a few months of manual HTML editing, I realized this approach wasn't sustainable. As my content grew, the constant manual adjustments became cumbersome. Enter [al-folio](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio), a popular academic website template.

This WordPress-based template was a game-changer. It introduced me to elegant solutions for component organization and taught me valuable lessons about website template workflows. I was content with this setup for about a year.

## Why Change Again?

While al-folio looked polished at first glance, challenges emerged as the developer updated their framework structure. I found myself frequently dealing with bugs and raising tickets, which became frustrating. The lack of control over the process made me realize I wanted something more customizable.

Though it was initially a simple Flask website, this experience pushed me to explore React.js, moving away from traditional HTML/CSS. This transition marked a significant shift in how I approached web development...

[To be continued as I document more of this journey!]

## What I Learned

Each iteration of my website taught me something valuable:

1. **First Version**: The importance of attention to detail and basic web development principles
2. **Second Version**: The power of templates and organized content management
3. **Current Version**: The value of having full control over your digital space

Stay tuned as I continue to evolve this space and share more about my journey in web development and academia!
