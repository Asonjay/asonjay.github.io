I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, co-advised by [Dr. Yu Xiang](https://yuxng.github.io/) and [Dr. Wei Yang](https://youngwei.com/). I work in the [Intelligent Robotics and Vision Lab (IRVL)](https://labs.utdallas.edu/irvl/). My current research focuses on reinforcement learning for robotics, with additional interests in post-training and learning technology. Recently, I led team ASTRO in the [Amazon Trust AI Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/trusted-ai-challenge), where we were selected as one of the five Red Teams globally and made it into the finals.

Prior to UTD, I completed both my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University, where I worked with [Dr. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/). During my master's program, I led the software engineering team for SalsaBot in the [Amazon Alexa Prize SimBot Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/simbot-challenge). In the field of learning technology, I collaborated with [Dr. Di Xu (UCI)](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6178), [Dr. Qiujie Li (NTU)](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp02328), and [Dr. Zilu Jiang (JHU)](https://new.every1graduates.org/zilu-jiang/) on TimeWise, an educational conversational agent project. Our team participated in the [Tools Competition 2024](https://tools-competition.org/) and was selected as one of the five finalists among approximately 2,000 submissions.
