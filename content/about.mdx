I'm Jeff Jadulco, I work full-time as a game programmer at [Secret 6, Inc](https://secret6.com). In my free time, I study front-end development with React. My goal is to write useful apps and contribute to open source projects while working a full-time job.

### Why make this website?

I made this website to learn what actually goes into web development. From planning, design, development, launch, and maintenance. For sure there are other things that I have yet to encounter, and I’m ready to learn them.

This also serves a motivation for me to continue making projects because now I finally have a place to showcase them.

### Why write a blog?

My [first blog post](/blog/welcome) explained it. I'd be happy if you read it :)

### What else?

When I’m not programming, I endlessly browse Reddit ([/r/gamedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/), [/r/formula1](https://www.reddit.com/r/formula1/), [/r/animalsbeingderps](https://www.reddit.com/r/animalsbeingderps/)). I also love watching [movies](https://letterboxd.com/jeffjadulco/) and listening to [music](https://open.spotify.com/user/jeffjads). You can catch me playing games sometimes, I play as xKore, xKored, or xKoreddd.
