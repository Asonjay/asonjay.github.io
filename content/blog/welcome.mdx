# Why make this website?

I made this website to learn what actually goes into web development. From planning, design, development, launch, and maintenance. For sure there are other things that I have yet to encounter, and I’m ready to learn them.

This also serves a motivation for me to continue making projects because now I finally have a place to showcase them.

# Why write a blog?

Since I’m still a web development beginner, this is a good opportunity for me to document my learning and share my process out there. This is also a perfect time to practice technical writing.
