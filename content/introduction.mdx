I am a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, advised by [Dr. Wei Yang](https://youngwei.com/). My research focuses on LLM-based systems and code Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly their security aspects including attack/defense mechanisms. Recently, I led team ASTRO to participate in the [Amazon Trust AI Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/trusted-ai-challenge), where we were selected as one of the Red Teaming groups. Beyond computer science research, I actively collaborate with educational researchers to explore how LLMs can enhance learning experiences and accelerate educational research through their innovative integration in both teaching and research contexts.

Prior to UTD, I completed both my M.S. and B.S. in Computer Science and Engineering at The Ohio State University, where I worked with [Dr. Yu Su](https://ysu1989.github.io/). During my master's program, I led the software engineering team for SalsaBot in the [Amazon Alexa Prize SimBot Challenge](https://www.amazon.science/alexa-prize/simbot-challenge). In the field of learning technology, I collaborated with [Dr. Di Xu (UCI)](https://www.faculty.uci.edu/profile/?facultyId=6178), [Dr. Qiujie Li (NTU)](https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/cris/rp/rp02328), and [Dr. Zilu Jiang (JHU)](https://new.every1graduates.org/zilu-jiang/) on TimeWise, an educational conversational agent project. Our team participated in the [Tools Competition 2024](https://tools-competition.org/) and was selected as one of the five finalists among approximately 2,000 submissions.

Beyond academia, I'm a gamer and I was a Rank 1 Restoration Shaman in World of Warcraft. When I'm not coding or gaming, you can find me enjoying board games, playing basketball, badminton, or swimming.
